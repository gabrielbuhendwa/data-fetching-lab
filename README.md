# Data Fetching Lab (Next.js)

A learning-focused project dedicated to exploring modern data fetching patterns and API consumption in Next.js applications.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical lab to understand how data flows in a Next.js app, including:

- Fetching data from external APIs
- Working with Server Components and Client Components
- Handling loading, error, and parallel states
- Exploring different data fetching strategies
- Understanding where and how data is fetched in a real application

This is **not a production-ready project**, but a structured learning space.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Fetch API
- Modern React patterns

## Notes

- Code may evolve as concepts are explored
- Experiments are intentional and focused on learning
- Structure reflects real-world scenarios, simplified for clarity

Built as part of a continuous learning process.
